# RentMyTools

A co-developed web application hosted on Firebase (not active) that faciliates co-sharing of powertools.

# Problem Statement

Minor home improvement works are becoming increasingly expensive. However,
so is the cost of powertools for their infrequent / one-time use. Hence,
our platform aims to connect owners and users, providing owners with a platform to
rent out their powertools, while providing an affordable alternative for renters.

# How it Works

Using Javascript with Vue.js framework, our site emulates the Carousell shopplace,
but for powertools! Through accessing our Firestore Database of listed products, our
web application dynamically updates product listings, search results and rental status,
offering a one-stop platform to find and list powertools!
